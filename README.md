Crocs Women Shoes Scraper This project is a web scraping tool designed to extract data on women's shoes from the Crocs website. The scraper collects essential product information such as product ID, name, badge, price, rating, review count, and links. This data is then organized and saved into a CSV file for further analysis or use.
Features:
Automated Browsing: Utilizes Selenium to automate browser actions and handle dynamic content loading.
Data Extraction: Employs BeautifulSoup to parse HTML and extract product details.
Data Storage: Saves the scraped data into a CSV file using Pandas for easy access and manipulation.
Error Handling: Includes try-except blocks to manage missing data and ensure robustness.
Technologies Used:
Python: The primary programming language used for the scraper.
Selenium: For browser automation and handling dynamic web content.
BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML and extracting necessary data.
Pandas: For organizing and storing the scraped data in a CSV format.
How It Works:
Setup: Configure Selenium with Chrome options to mimic a real user and bypass bot detection.
